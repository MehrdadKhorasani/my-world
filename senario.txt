My world:
Yes You came in my world. there is no exit. you must find a way to the path of substance. oh yes. there it is: "You".

you can only choose and bring one object into your journey.
choose wisely. but what is wisdom? who knows?

the objects are: "a book" "a knife" "letter from an old love"

yes  you chose the one you wanted!
